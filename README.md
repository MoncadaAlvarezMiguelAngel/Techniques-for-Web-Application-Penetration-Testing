# Exploitation of a Web Application: Buffer Overflow and Python as Attack Vectors

## Objective

The developed work involves the automation of different parts of the pentesting process
in web applications. For this purpose, functions for reconnaissance and injection of malicious
payloads using brute force with Python are performed. Using a methodological approach based
on practical tests with DVWA, the effectiveness of these techniques for identifying and exploiting
security flaws is demonstrated. The most significant results include the successful exploitation
of various vulnerabilities and the validation of Python as a powerful tool for pentesting. In
summary, this project highlights the need to implement and maintain robust security measures
in web application development to prevent cyber attacks
